I'm Vuong (vɨəŋ˧˧ / v-oo-aw-ng), a software engineer with a decade-long passion for software development experiences. 
From the early days of HTML5, I've been immersed in the world of web development, building everything from interactive front-ends to robust back-ends.

For several years, I've been drawn to the idea of contributing to open-source projects. Relying on these tools daily has deepened my appreciation for the community. 
I believe that by sharing my knowledge and skills, I can both grow as a developer and give back to the ecosystem that has supported my work.

More than a serious introduction, this is my favorite scene in <b><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085334">A Christmas Story</a></b> movie. 
I don't know why I love it!
