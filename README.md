I'm Vuong (vɨəŋ˧˧ / v-oo-aw-ng), a software engineer with a decade-long passion for crafting digital experiences. 
From the early days of HTML5, I've been immersed in the world of web development, building everything from interactive front-ends to robust back-ends. 
My toolbelt includes:
- PHP
- Go
- Databases: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL
- HTML/CSS/JS

For several years, I've been drawn to the idea of contributing to open-source projects. 
Relying on these tools daily has deepened my appreciation for the community. 
I believe that by sharing my knowledge and skills, I can both grow as a developer and give back to the ecosystem that has supported my work.

More than a serious introduction, this is my favorite scene in **[A Christmas Story](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085334/)** movie. 
I don't know why I love it!
